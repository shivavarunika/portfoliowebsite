            <h3>Open-Set Recognition in Unknown DDoS Attack Detection with Reciprocal Points Learning</h3>
            <p>Developed the "Open-Set Recognition in Unknown DDoS Attack Detection with Reciprocal Points Learning" project to identify unknown DDoS attacks using machine learning algorithms such as Passive-Aggressive, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. The project leverages Reciprocal Points Learning to detect novel attack patterns, while Flask is used for backend deployment. Data processing is handled with Pandas, and Sklearn and Imbalanced-learn are applied to address class imbalance. The system stores attack data in MySQL, offering an efficient solution for real-time detection of both known and unknown DDoS attacks.</p>
